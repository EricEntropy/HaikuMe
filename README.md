Hello! 

Do you like to express yourself in a way that differs from the rest? 
Do you like your posts on the internet to be complex and deep? 

HaikuMe is for you! 

With this simple app, you can create haikus and share them with the world. 

Haikus are comprised of three lines: 
1. Must be FIVE syllables long.
2. Must be SEVEN syllables long.
3. Must be FIVE syllables long.

You can also add themes to your haikus to keep track of where the haikus belong to. 

Happy writing!
